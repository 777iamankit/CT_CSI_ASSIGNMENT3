# Callback ⇒ Promise ⇒ Async/Await Conversion

This repo demonstrates three ways to perform an asynchronous “multiply” operation in JavaScript:

1. **Callback**  
2. **Promise**  
3. **Async/Await**

## 📖 Overview

In this assignment you will see:

- How a traditional callback function works  
- How to wrap it in a `Promise` and handle `.then() / .catch() / .finally()`  
- How to call the same logic with `async`/`await` and `try...catch`
